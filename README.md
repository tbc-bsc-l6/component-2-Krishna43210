# component3

This extends on the previous exercises and will remove the json file and replace with models and a database. It will also add authentication and allow for a differentiation in customer and admin type roles. You can make the choice of whether to keep Blade based templates as used in Component 2 or move to an API type scenario and respond directly with json formatted data to Vue driven clients. 

Requirements are:
<ul>
  <li> use of Model Classes and Eloquent ORM for working with data/database</li>
  <li> Factories for seeding and simulating large amounts of data in the database</li>
  <li>authentication</li>
  <li>good practice in software development</li>
</ul>

You are expected to demonstrate your end product in a video format and support your understanding and knowledge of developing web applications in a follow up Question and Answer session(VIVA session)
